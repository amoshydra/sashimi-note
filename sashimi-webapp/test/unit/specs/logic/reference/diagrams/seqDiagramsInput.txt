```sequence
Alice->Bob: Hello Bob, how are you?
Note right of Bob: Bob thinks
Bob-->Alice: I am good thanks!
Note left of Alice: Alice responds
Alice->Bob: Where have you been?
```

```sequence
participant C
participant B
participant A
Note right of A: By listing the participants\n you can change their order
```

```sequence
# Example of a comment.
Note left of A: Note to the\n left of A
Note right of A: Note to the\n right of A
Note over A: Note over A
Note over A,B: Note over both A and B
```

```sequence

A->B: Normal line
B-->C: Dashed line
C->>D: Open arrow
D-->>A: Dashed open arrow
```

```sequence
